# AndroidOnnxOcrinfrence
Starting to Work!!

android io for the onnx easyocr models provided by qualcom (https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/trocr)

built as I wanted to be able to train independent models for detection and recog which cannot be done with the standard google ml kit



RIGHT NOW
- reads image inputs from file (800x640)
- runs both models
- logs expected output


TODO
- fix the ratio for dynamic image loading 
- use phone camera for image input
- display the expected output

I doubt anyone is seeing this but DM me or email at mattwooll.a@gmail.com for any ideas/suggestions, or if you want to understand the back bone
